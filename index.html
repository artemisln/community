        <h4>Black Women</h4>
        <p>Black women experience both a race and gender wage gap that reflects the intersectional reality of their daily lives. The sharpest earnings differences are between Black women and white men, who are benchmarked as the highest earners, but Black women also experience wage disparities when compared with white women and Black men. As experts have noted, it is important to understand that this race-gender wage gap consists of more than simply adding the separate numbers associated with each gap. Rather, it reflects a unique effect that results from how the combination of race and gender are perceived together.</p>

        <h4>Asian Women</h4>
        <p>Even in the media, Asian women have been subjected to various forms of racial fetishization and sexism, perpetuated by age-old stereotypes. From Trang Pak and Sun Jin Dinh being statutorily raped in Mean Girls (2004) to the infamous “Me love you long time” quote from a Vietnamese prostitute soliciting herself to American military men in Full Metal Jacket (1987); The sad thing is, these media depictions are also intertwined with history itself. </p>

        <h4>Indian Women</h4>
        <p>Discrimination against women and girls is a pervasive and long-running phenomenon that characterises Indian society at every level. India’s progress towards gender equality, measured by its position on rankings such as the Gender Development Index has been disappointing, despite fairly rapid rates of economic growth. In the past decade, while Indian GDP has grown by around 6%, there has been a large decline in female labour force participation from 34% to 27%.</p>
